Dear Warren,

I reviewed your case with Dylan and I would like to apologize for the lack of context when he informed you the case would be closed.  We have taken measures to ensure that this will not happen in the future.

The request that you had made was:

When creating a Visualization in Designer that is Run with Insight, if a filter is applied from within Designer before running with Insight, the filter cannot be changed to its other possible values.

I checked with engineering and unfortunately having this change made is not on the roadmap at this time.

I appreciate you taking out the time to fill out the survey and look forward to working with you in the future.

A review of this case indicates that the Support Engineer provided a clear and concise answer in terms of what capabilities that existed with respect to the customer's inquiry. In addition, he created a Jira ticket to see if there was any additional information that could be relayed in terms of the customer's inquiry but the customer took this as a negative action. The customer responded with a clear understanding of the information that was relayed to him via the case after the conference call. The real issue is the fact that the customer wanted a simple yes or no answer at the start of the case and we were trying to be proactive to fully understand and address the customer's issue. It did not help that the customer had responded to confirm a conference call on Sunday for Monday morning, so the SE was not aware and not available at the very start of the perceived conference call. While not ideal, I do not believe this is the cause of this negative survey. The SE required a conference call with the customer to ensure he had a clear understanding of the inquiry. Once this took place, the conference call made it clear where we stood in terms of product capabilities.",,"Documentation should be considered but it cannot always cover all possible 3rd party products. We have an open Jira that could be leveraged to update our documentation as well. Separately, in terms of process, there was the conference call date and time suggested. It helps to clarify with customers that without a firm confirmation, that date and time will not remain available. The SE SME for this case will do so in the future. Another aspect to process is to try to have a conference call earlier in this process when there is some back in forth. This case progressed as expected. One SE transferred the case fairly quickly to the senior SE SME. The SE SME required clarity but provided some initial information in terms of answer.
